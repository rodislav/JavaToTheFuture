For previous versions of jdk you can download the binaries from:

https://jdk.java.net/archive/

This module requires JDK 9.

In case of `Error:java: release version 10 not supported`
> `10` is just an example, you could get any other number than 9, like 11, 8, etc.

Go to `File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Compiler | Java Compiler`
and pick the version 9 for this module.
